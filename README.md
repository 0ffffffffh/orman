ORMAN is an experimental ORM (object relational mapping) framework for Java
aimed to support ISO SQL:1999 standard. Coded purely in Java SE with no dependencies.

Designed to be able to handle simple and common cases of SQL usage in CRUD projects.

Using ORMAN, you can save Java objects to the database and query the database without
writing SQL statements. It is small, lightweight, works on Android devices, as well as 
Java desktop applications.
